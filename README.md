# README

This is a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) [quick start](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#a-minimal-application) example from [Render](https://render.com) which I have modified to fetch jokes.

## Deployment

If you want to play with this, fork it, then follow the guide at https://render.com/docs/deploy-flask to get a free account for hosting the app. Easy-peasy.
